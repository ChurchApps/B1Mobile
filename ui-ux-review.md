## ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement

### 1. Visual Design System Inconsistencies

#### Issues:
- **Mixed UI Libraries**: Combination of React Native Paper, custom components, and legacy styling creates visual inconsistency
- **Color System Fragmentation**: Multiple color definitions across Constants.tsx and individual theme objects
- **Typography Inconsistency**: Mix of React Native Paper variants and custom font sizing
- **Component Styling**: Inconsistent button styles, card layouts, and spacing patterns

#### Recommendations:
```typescript
// Consolidate into a single design system
const designSystem = {
  colors: {
    primary: {
      50: '#E3F2FD',
      500: '#0D47A1', // Main brand color
      900: '#0D47A1'
    },
    neutral: {
      50: '#F6F6F8',
      100: '#F0F0F0',
      500: '#9E9E9E',
      900: '#3c3c3c'
    }
  },
  typography: {
    h1: { fontSize: 24, fontWeight: '700' },
    h2: { fontSize: 20, fontWeight: '600' },
    body: { fontSize: 16, fontWeight: '400' }
  },
  spacing: {
    xs: 4, sm: 8, md: 16, lg: 24, xl: 32
  }
}
```

### 2. Navigation and Information Architecture

#### Issues:
- **Drawer Navigation Complexity**: The drawer becomes crowded with dynamic menu items
- **Deep Navigation Paths**: Some features require too many taps to access
- **Inconsistent Back Button Behavior**: Mix of hardware back, header back, and custom navigation

#### Recommendations:
- **Tab Bar Navigation**: Consider a bottom tab bar for primary features (Dashboard, Groups, Sermons, Directory)
- **Simplified Drawer**: Reserve drawer for secondary features and user account management
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Add breadcrumbs for deep navigation paths
- **Consistent Navigation Patterns**: Standardize back button behavior across all screens

### 3. User Onboarding and Authentication Flow

#### Issues:
- **Church Selection UX**: The church search is powerful but could be more intuitive for first-time users
- **Registration Flow**: The registration screen appears incomplete (commented out API calls)
- **Anonymous vs Authenticated States**: Complex logic for handling different user states

#### Recommendations:
- **Guided Onboarding**: Add a welcome flow explaining the app's purpose and features
- **Improved Church Discovery**: Add location-based suggestions and popular churches
- **Progressive Registration**: Simplify initial signup, allow users to explore before full registration
- **Clear State Indicators**: Better visual feedback for authentication status

### 4. Content Presentation and Layout

#### Issues:
- **Dashboard Layout**: While functional, the dashboard could better showcase church content
- **Image Fallbacks**: Generic fallback images don't provide engaging visual hierarchy
- **Content Density**: Some screens (like sermons) pack too much information without clear visual hierarchy
- **Loading States**: Basic loading indicators don't provide engaging feedback

#### Recommendations:
- **Hero Content**: Redesign dashboard with more prominent hero sections for featured content
- **Custom Illustrations**: Replace generic fallbacks with custom church-themed illustrations
- **Content Cards**: Implement consistent card design system with proper typography hierarchy
- **Skeleton Loading**: Replace loading spinners with skeleton screens for better perceived performance

### 5. Interaction Design and Accessibility

#### Issues:
- **Touch Targets**: Some interactive elements may not meet minimum 44px touch target requirements
- **Feedback Systems**: Limited haptic feedback and visual state changes
- **Accessibility**: No evidence of accessibility labels or screen reader support
- **Error Handling**: Basic alert dialogs for error states

#### Recommendations:
- **Touch Target Audit**: Ensure all interactive elements meet accessibility guidelines
- **Micro-interactions**: Add subtle animations and transitions for better user feedback
- **Accessibility First**: Implement proper accessibility labels, contrast ratios, and screen reader support
- **Error State Design**: Create custom error components with better visual design and actionable messaging
